/**
 * A very simple single page app router which unlike the others that I have
 * tried (ko-component-router and Senna.js) doesn't try the be extra smart
 * and ain't shaken by so many nasty bugs. The main concept is nearly the
 * same as with Senna.js:
 *
 * The router manages a set of surfaces (DOM elements) whose contents need
 * to be swapped when the user navigates to another URL. Therefor the router
 * contains a list of regex routes agains which the current URL is matched.
 * If a match is found a Screen class/object will be found which is queried
 * for the content of each surface element.
 *
 * But unlike Senna.js this implementation allows to load Screens in background
 * (by returning a Promise object) whereas Senna.js wants the Screen class to be
 * defined upfront. In Senna.js the background loading is performed by the Screen
 * object. Here the background loading is performend when the Screen object is
 * loaded and optionally whereas the Screen methods must not be asynchronous.
 * Also this implementation guarantees strict ordering of the surface updates
 * because so a surface may contain another surface which is also managed by
 * the router. And it is possible to remove a surface from the router again.
 * Lastly the router expects to get the name of a ko-component to display
 * inside each surface instead of the final HTML string.
 *
 * Well and unlike ko-component-router this one actually works and doesn't have
 * all those nasty bugs which costed me several days to debug. So call it
 * Not-Invented-Here but this special app has special requirements which are
 * just not met by the other implementations.
