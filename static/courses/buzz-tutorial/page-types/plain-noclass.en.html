<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This is the simplest page type. It is simply an HTML page with any content.
    However, the design is also the most difficult, as you have to get along with
    the size of even large screens, where the text is easily torn too far apart.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, there are different page types of different sizes. In particular
    the grids can help with the design.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>plain</dt>
    <dd>Empty page with maximum width (this is the default page type)</dd>

    <dt>grid-large</dt>
    <dd>Centered CSS grid with a maximum width of 1280 px</dd>

    <dt>grid-medium</dt>
    <dd>Centered CSS grid with a maximum width of 960 px</dd>

    <dt>grid-small</dt>
    <dd>Centered CSS grid with a maximum width of 480 px</dd>

    <dt>grid-fullwidth</dt>
    <dd>CSS grid which uses the full window width</dd>

    <dt>grid-fullscreen</dt>
    <dd>CSS grid which additionally gets stretched to the bottom window border</dd>

<h2>course.yaml Example</h2>
<p>
    And this is how the <tt>course.yaml</tt> looks:
</p>
<source-code language="yaml" filename="course.yaml">
    ---
    language: ""
    name: Buzz Tutorial
    pages:
        page-types/plain/:
            name: Simple Pages Without a Template
            type: grid-large
            file: page-types/plain.en.html
        ...
</source-code>
