    Within the individual HTML pages, of course, any content may be used. However,
    care should be taken that the pages do not contain too much content. Less is
    really more. It becomes problematic especially when the tabreaders scroll
    too far away because there is a risk that they will be forgotten.

    It is best to use simple, striking content for the tab pages or short
    explanations like this one.
