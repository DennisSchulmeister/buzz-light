<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Course pages contain no background of their own by default, so that the
    website background is fully visible. However this can make pages with a
    lot of text hard to read. Thus each page may be assigned one or more
    classes in the <tt>course.yaml</tt> file in order to influence their
    background.
</p>
<p>
    The following classes can be used:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>white</dt>
    <dd>Bright background with dark font</dd>

    <dt>black</dt>
    <dd>Dark background with bright font</dd>

    <dt>padding</dt>
    <dd>
        Adds a little space around the text so that it doesn't stick so much
        at the border
    </dd>
</dl>
<br />

<h2>course.yaml Example</h2>
<p>
    The background is set like this:
</p>
<source-code language="yaml" filename="course.yaml">
    ---
    language: ""
    name: Buzz Tutorial
    pages:
        page-types/plain/white/:
            name: Simple Page With White Background
            type: grid-large
            file: page-types/plain-white.en.html
            classes:
                - white
                - padding
        ...
</source-code>
